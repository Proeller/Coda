# Coda 
## A monospaced coding font with special ligatures for C#.

The C# programming language uses a lot of character pairs to form special operators like two plus glyphs '++' to increment a value, two equal glyphs '==' to check for equality or the equal and greater glyph '=>' for the lambda operator.
**Coda** combines these and a 21 further combinations to [ligatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature) in oder to improve code readability and productivity.

But first and foremost, **Coda** has to meet a number of requirements to be a great coding font:
+ It has to be monospaced, that means, all characters have the same width.
+ The width of the characters shouldn't be to wide, because even long code lines should fit on the screen.
+ The same is true for the character height. Productivity grows with the numbers of lines you can see at a glance. 
+ All charactes must be easily distinguisable. This is especially important for characters like uppercase and lowercase letter L, uppercase letter I, number one, uppercase letter O and number zero as well as for punctuation signs like semicolon, colon, comma and period.
+ Even at small font sizes like 9 point on a normal 96 dpi monitor, the font has to be sharp and crisp. 
+ And finally the overall impression should be fresh and comfortable.

C# programmers usually work with Microsoft Visual Studio which comes with the Consolas font designed by [Luc(as) de Groot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc(as)_de_Groot). Consolas is a very sophisticated and exceptionally well designed font that neary meets all of the requirements. Only the distinctiveness of the numer one (1), the lowercase letter L and  the uppercase letter I is difficult at small font sizes like 9 or 10 pt.

**Coda** ist based on the Abobe's open source font [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) but strongly revised to meet the compactness and space efficiency of the Consolas.
